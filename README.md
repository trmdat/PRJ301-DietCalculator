This web app is a final project of course PRJ301, which aims at constructing a basic, introductory, yet complete application to serve a specific purpose. Serving such targets, PGNB has created a place where you can custom your meals and find suggestions for dietary supplements, which are our products.

## Conclusion
-	Pros:
    -	We offer well-rounded, comprehensive services about diet and supplements for users. Besides, rich controlling features are also provided to the admin users. 
    -	Our selling points include the mailing feature, good user interface, …

-	Cons:
    -	Our team took the front-end template from multiple different sites. That leads to the CSS applying several times while the page load.
    -	While we were working in GIT, we faced a lot of conflicts. But because we didn't learn how to use GIT ourselves first, we got a hard time fixing them. 
    -	We found that we are too ambitious for planning so many features for our project. Although we end up complete about 90% of the features, but these features can be more optimal and better for customer experience if we just focus on less of them.

## Project improvement
  -	To improve the front-end: we will find a front-end THEME rather than multiple-page sources. It will make our CSS more synchronize and make our page looks better.
  -	More complete features to make the user experience better and avoid unknown bugs.
  -	Improve code clarity
  -	Apply design patterns
  -	Make some API features
  -	Try to deploy the web online
